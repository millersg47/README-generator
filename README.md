  ## Description
  This is a command line application used to generate a README markdown file based on a template with user inputs pulled from prompts in the command line. The application runs in node.js and uses the inquirer package as well as the filesystem built-in package.

  ## Installation
  To install the application, clone the Git repo to your local machine, open command line terminal and enter node index.js.
  
  ## Usage    
  The use case for the project is to speed up the time it takes a developer to write a new README file for every project. This allows them to quickly generate one from the command line by entering a series of prompts. Then once generated, they can customize it further if they would like to. The generator fits all the basic requirements of a README file.
